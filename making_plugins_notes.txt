pyrcc4 reads the .qrc file, and the resource files, and generates a Python module that only needs to be imported by the application in order for those resources to be made available just as if they were the original files.
In addition to the command line options that are common with rcc, the following are also supported:
-py2
Generate code that will work for all versions of Python v2.x. Although this is the default, the option should be specified explicitly in case the default is changed in a future version.
-py3
Generate code that will work for all versions of Python starting with Python v2.6.
pyrcc4 will only be included if your copy of Qt includes the XML module.
